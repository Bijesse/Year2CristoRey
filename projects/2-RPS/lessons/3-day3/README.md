## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: Teacher takes student attendance 
2. Go to tinyurl.com/script1106 solve the problem asked in the comments section


### Opening

Today we will use the same concepts just used in the starter to track the score in the RPS game

Last class we were figuring out how to pick a winner using the pickWinnner function 

### Introduction of new material ("I do")
On board look at the pickWinner function.. read the comments out loud

'''

				//if
                    //add user points, return user points
                //else if
                    // add ai point, return ai
                // else return draw
              

              // step 1 - evaluate user and ai value
              // step 2 - compare each value using conditionals
              // step 3 - declare outcome
              

'''

all together get the following line

'''
		
		if ((userValue == "rock" && aiValue == 'scissors'))
'''



### Guided practice ("We do")

Now that we have the first scenario get the other two situations where the human wins over the ai.

### Independent practice ("You do")

You create the ai win and draw scenarios

### Introduction of new material #2 ("I do")

We need add a system that creates the points inside the curly brackets
