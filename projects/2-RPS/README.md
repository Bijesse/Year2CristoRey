![Image](./rps.jpg?raw=true)

##Synopsis

This project will introduce the student to simple one page javascript app to play Rock-Paper-Scissors. They will be introduced to the idea of libraries and the use the use the JQuery library to manage events.  The students should have previous experience with events and event handlers.  Furthermore they will be introduced to Random numbers and how they are simulated in computers.  After they have completed the simple game, they can be asked to complete a more complex variant, [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](./rpslp.jpg).

##Industry Skills
This project improves the student's industry skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**Technical Vocabulary:**  

While completing this project the student will learn about how to simulate random numbers in javascript. She will also learn to apply the JQuery library to bind user actions to behavior in an application. She will also have the opportunity to modify the initial app to add features as new requirements are revealed.

**Version Control:**   

The student will be asked to create an initial version of RPS. After they have committed that version and confirmed that it works, they can begin to modifying it to create the more complicated RPSLS version.

**Code Review:**   

While completing this project, the student will have the opportunity to provide feed back to their peers and in turn recive feedback from others about the design and code choices they have made.

**Search Engine Skills:**  

While completing this project the student will have to use and augment their search engine skills to find how to use JQuery.
They will probably also have to search for usages of Math.random

**Command Line:**  

...

**Debugging**  

While completing this project the student will have the opportunity to use a debugger to step over their code to see the logic of the program that they're writing.

##Web Programming Skills
This project improves the student's web programming skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**Forms:**  
While completing this project the student will be exposed to the form elements like Button and Submit that they can bind events onto.

**Templating:**   
While completing this project the student will be able to use simple templates to generate messages to their users.


##Year One Review
