### Opening

Today we will learn what an API is and how to use them 

### Introduction of new material ("I do")

API = Application Program Interface  
What does this mean?  
Sometimes websites/applications want to share some of their functionality with other apps, Like Facebook wants every other apps to be able to share with Facebook  
Facebook has internal code: Code that determines how facebook works (what shows up in your feed)   
I can’t access that (well maybe but that would be very hard)
And external facing code: Code that other developers can access to use some of the functionality Facebook lets me use  
API = a set of rules that determine how one application talks to another
APIs make it possible for apps like Facebook or Twitter to let other apps use their services  
ex: go to Soundcloud.com and show Facebook share  
Q: What are other examples you’ve see of apps using APIs?  
A: Sign up with Facebook/Twitter  
API call = An operation my application can perform with another application’s API    
when my app talks to another app through their API, I am making an API call
In order to use an API, I need to know how it works!  
API documentation = A quick and concise reference containing what you need to know to use an API
