#Project 5 - SoundMood
![Image](http://)

##Synopsis

SoundMood is a project that allows the user to listen to a song based on their mood.    

The provided starter code lacks four functionalities vital to the way in which SoundMood functions. The student must add the following:

* **Search**: Simply type in the mood you are currently in and a song will be generated based on that mood
* **Hear**: We grab all of our songs directly from Soundcloud, so there are millions of selections.
* **Explore**: Using Soundmood, you can find hundreds of songs based on unique mood
* **Quantity &amp; Quality**: Soundmood has a selection of many different emotions/mood, so good luck entering one that doesn't exist.
