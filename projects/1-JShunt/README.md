##Scope
This main goal of this project to re-familiarize the students with the skills learned in year 1. The structure of the project is to have many short (<10 lines) programs that all have a point value determined by difficulty. There are many programs to choose from but the length of this project should be made by the teacher's discretion. **The project should end when the teacher feels that all students in the class are ready to move on to project 2.** 



#Before Class
*The teacher should familiarize themselves with the programs in the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md). This will help the teacher prepare for any questions that may arise.
*Have a system for checking off every program a student completes. It is important to keep track of which program each student has completed. This way they cannot submit a program twice. 
* Set up a scoreboard --  either digital or written.
*Printing a copy of the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md) for each student is recommended. 

##Vocabulary
* String
* Variable
* Conditional
* Loop
