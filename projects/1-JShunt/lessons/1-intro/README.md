## Before class

###Teacher Preperation
* Must have copies of [syllabus](Syllabus.docx) printed
* The teacher should familiarize themselves with the programs in the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md). This will help the teacher prepare for any questions that may arise.
* Have a system for checking off every program a student completes. It is important to keep track of which program each student has completed. This way they cannot submit a program twice. 
* Set up a scoreboard --  either digital or written.
* Printing a copy of the [Clues Worksheet](clues/README.md) for each student is recommended.
